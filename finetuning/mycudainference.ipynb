      "what is rust lang?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Rust is a systems programming language that is designed to be secure, reliable, and fast. It is a compiled language, meaning that your code will be converted to machine code before it is run on a computer. Rust is often used for developing operating systems, file formats, and other complex systems that require low-level control over a computer's hardware and software components. Rust also has built-in support for common tasks such as memory safety, borrowing, and concurrency. Rust is an actively maintained language and continues to be rapidly improving and expanding in functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other topics for rust:\n",
      "\n",
      "- rust toolchain\n",
      "- rust standard library\n",
      "- rust language features\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Rust is a language that is well-suited for a wide range of tasks, from low-level systems programming to high-level web development, and the language is still actively evolving and growing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a rust Lang tutorial or resources that I can use to help me in this journey?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are plenty of tutorials, resources, and guides available online for learning Rust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some popular ones are Rust by Example - Rust by Example, Rust for C++ Developers - Rust for C++ Developers, and Rust Programming Language - Rust Programming Language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, you can check out the official Rust book, which is a comprehensive guide to the language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, learning Rust requires dedication, effort, and plenty of practice. However, with the right resources and guidance, it can be a very rewarding experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, there are many online guides and tutorials available that can help you learn Rust. There are also many resources available for learning more about the language and its underlying philosophy and development. Finally, it's important to use Rust actively and consistently to develop muscle memory.\n"
